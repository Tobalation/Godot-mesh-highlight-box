# Godot 3.X mesh highlight box
 A 2D screen space bounding box for MeshInstances

![Example of boxes in action](https://github.com/Tobalation/Godot-mesh-highlight-box/blob/main/icon.png)

## Basic summary
 This project is an example for creating 2D screen space bounding boxes for highlighting 3D meshes that adjust to fit the mesh on screen perfectly in real time.
 
 An example of this type of UI element would be selection highlight boxes of units in RTS games or
 a classification box in a computer vision program output window. 

## Notes
 Usage with animated skinned meshes has not been tested, but technically it should still work but with less accuracy.
